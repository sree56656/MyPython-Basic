#  to print list in for loop
# mylist = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
# for element in mylist:
#     print(element)

# for num in mylist:
#     print("sree")


# even or odd
# for num in mylist:
#     if num % 2 == 0:
#         print("even number : ", num)
#     else:
#         print("odd number : ", num)

# sum of list numbers
# sum = 0
# for num in mylist:
#     sum+=num
#
# print("sum is : ", sum)

# for loop with strings

# for element in "Hello World":
#     print(element)

# for loop with tuples

mytup = [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)]
# print(type(mytup))
# for ele in mytup:
#     print(ele)
#     for num in ele:
#         print(num)

# duplicating the tuple => tuple unpacking
# for a,b in mytup:
#     print(a)

# Dictionary iterations

d = {'k1': 1, 'k2': 2, 'k3': 3}
# for key in d:
#     print(key)          # prints only key
# for key in d.items():
#     print(key)          # prints key and value
# for key, value in d.items():
#     print(value)         # prints whichever we want
